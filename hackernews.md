There have been several page one nushell posts on hacker news over the years.  Here are the highlights from some of them...

##### [LLVM for shell scripts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33433840)

Nushell looks pretty good!
But, how to automatically convert all existing shell scripts -- to Nushell?

I think it would be highly interesting if someone created "an LLVM for shell scripts"...

In other words -- given a shell script that runs on one shell, turn that into a parse tree -- then transpile that parse tree back into a script such that the transpiled script runs on a different shell -- with guaranteed full compatibility...

Maybe some work in this area is being done, or already has been done...

I'd be interested if anyone knew of anything like this...

If so -- then links would be appreciated!
