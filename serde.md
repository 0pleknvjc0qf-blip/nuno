I'm wondering if it would be worth it to port this from old-nushell to current-nushell and then update a bunch of code to use it? https://github.com/lily-mara/serde-nu

What are you thinking of using that for?
(seems cool, just wondering how we'd use it)

I'm just thinking of the dozens of places where we go from primitive types to nushell values and vice-versa. Just wondering if there's a better way than duplicating code all over the place to go to and from nushell values.
