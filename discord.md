### More details on $in

another way to think of it:

```rust
ls | $in
```

becomes:

```rust  
ls | collect { |x| $x }
```

Collect takes the iterator, drains it, and turns it into a value that it assigns to the variable. From there it calls the block and runs it
so:

```rust
3 | $in + 4
```

becomes:  

```rust
3 | collect { |x| $x + 4 }
```

(it's not always an iterator, like the above sometimes it's a single value)
but the general case is that collect runs and turns the input into a value. Wherever that data came from, if it has state, will now be drained/emptied

### How to access nu variable

* sorry but i cant figure out how to access the nu variable ðŸ˜› any hints?

* is it possible to declare a function so its usable by the user inside a block?

* I believe def-env makes it global, and let-env for variables.

* What is the difference between a PipelineMetadata::Value and PipelineMetadata::Stream ?

    * the Value case is a fully-known, finite value, and stream is a set of values of unknown length (possibly infinite) --- meaning its an Iterator.


* In the source command it uses position 1 for the block_id

    * lite_parse takes tokens and groups them for you, but doesn't do a full parse
    * lite_parse and parse both run at keystroke and submit
    * To do syntax highlighting we do a full parse that includes classifying what everything is so we know the correct style for each span
