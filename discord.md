### the source command is going away

Summary of a breaking change moving forward.

This change will most likely land the release
after the August 16th release next week.

In the past you could use the keyword source for scripts
with custom commands, aliases, and environment variables

Moving forward this will no longer be the case.

source-env will be for environment variables
use will be for custom commands and aliases

### Note on Lazy Dataframes

Lazy frames are a collection of operations done in a dataframe that are not executed until you collect on them.

In theory this allows for better memory management because the query planner can optimise the operations.

With normal df operations each operation is executed and it may not be optimised.

The goal would be for everything to be lazy to allow for more optimisations.

Eventually everything should be done via expressions over lazyframes

#### NU_LIB_DIRS

you can add any dir to $env.NU_LIB_DIRS so you can have a dozen different folders where you can just do source blah.nu and nushell finds it and sources it.

but it's not auto-sourcing - it just finds the full path to the file when you say source blah.nu

[How do you run an external command based on a variable content?](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/601130461678272524/982691281572618330)

```rust
^$variable
```

### More details on $in

another way to think of it:

```rust
ls | $in
```

becomes:

```rust  
ls | collect { |x| $x }
```

Collect takes the iterator, drains it, and turns it into a value that it assigns to the variable. From there it calls the block and runs it
so:

```rust
3 | $in + 4
```

becomes:  

```rust
3 | collect { |x| $x + 4 }
```

(it's not always an iterator, like the above sometimes it's a single value)
but the general case is that collect runs and turns the input into a value. Wherever that data came from, if it has state, will now be drained/emptied

### Notes of interest

* sorry but i cant figure out how to access the nu variable ðŸ˜› any hints?

* is it possible to declare a function so its usable by the user inside a block?

* I believe def-env makes it global, and let-env for variables.

    * the Value case is a fully-known, finite value, and stream is a set of values of unknown length (possibly infinite) --- meaning its an Iterator.


* In the source command it uses position 1 for the block_id

    * lite_parse takes tokens and groups them for you, but doesn't do a full parse
    * lite_parse and parse both run at keystroke and submit
    * To do syntax highlighting we do a full parse that includes classifying what everything is so we know the correct style for each span
