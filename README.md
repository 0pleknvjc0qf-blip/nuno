### Kubouch great explanation of parsing

Would it help if you imagine parsing exactly as compiling? You could think of running Nushell code in similar terms as running Rust or C code: You compile source code to a machine code, then use a CPU hardware to run the compiled machine code and get some values back. In Nushell, instead of machine code, we compile (= parse) Nu language into a data structure (Expression, etc.). Then, we use the engine to evaluate the Expressions to produce Values. We're essentially a compiled language in the same sense as Rust or C but instead of compiling to assembly, we compile to our own intermediate representation. But we ultimately face the same limitations as the "traditional" languages.

[discord reference](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615329862395101194/1051797499620372520)

### Discussion about nushell parser grammars which is not happening...

* [discord link](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615329862395101194/1022483303669960894)

Also, we're currently experimenting with moving our syntax to a static grammar and trying out different syntax ideas: https://github.com/nushell/grammar. We're also preparing a rewrite of our parser once we have the grammar ready. One way that changed is also parsing the command calls: The parsing will happen the same way regardless of whether the command is extrernal or internal, but it would be the type checker that would match parsed command call to the expected signature. Therefore, at the output of the parser, we'll have all the arguments and their ordering, so we'd just need a mechanism to loosen up the rules in the type-checking stage and expose this information in the function body (maybe have a built-in $args variable?).

So, with the new way of thinking, the first part of "fall-through" signatures might come naturally, we just need to come up with a good way to do the second part (how to expose the args within the function).

### source

In the past you could use the keyword **source** for scripts
with custom commands, aliases, and environment variables

Moving forward this will no longer be the case.

* source-env will be for environment variables which can now have dynamic paths
* use will be for custom commands and aliases

### Nulib Dirs

the default_env defines NU_LIB_DIRS which has a default "scripts" folder. If you put any nu script in there you can just source it by source name.nu

### String Stuff

```rust
7z x ($env.SOME_ARCHIVE_PATH) -o($env.DEPLOY_DIR)
```

* [You need to use a string interpolation to expand the -o string](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/6352)

```rust
$"-o($env.DEPLOY_DIR)"
```

### Why do we need a $ sign for variables ?

someone asked:
i dont really know what using let $bla brings when you could do let bla

@kubouch reply:
This would confuse it with external commands. If Nushell sees a bare word (e.g., pwd) where it cannot be a string, it considers it an external command. Ditching $ would make bare words ambiguous: let x = pwd could mean both "run pwd command" and "fetch pwd variable". So I personally see $ useful.

JT response: Like @Kubouch says, having the $ makes variables unambiguous.

### query db command

loving your query db command. i have a question though.
i ran this command and it works as expected...

```rust
open ./cities.db | query db "select * from cities where country = 'New Zealand' order by city"
```

however if i do let db = (open ./cities.db) and then $db | query db "blah" it doesn't work.

do i need to open the file each time?

i mean, obviously, you do but what i'd like to do is store the open connection as above and just use it.

#### How errors are displayed

```rust

#### Adding env.nu, why ?

Just for some context, if I understand correctly env.nu was added because we otherwise couldn't access the updated environment variables in config.nu (for env vars that were updated in config.nu). That meant that we couldn't use files in any of the NU_LIB_DIRS from config.nu, because that env var was defined in the same file. By first sourcing env.nu and defining NU_LIB_DIRS there, we can now use files from those directories in config.nu. Is that correct?

#### Export and use

in order to use blah.nu * you need to have exported defs as well like export def on the defs that you want to be able to call externally - if defs are called internally by other defs only, they don't need to be exported.

#### how the bang and history commands work

if you type history | last 10 and look the index columns - that's what you use with !number... if you're in ctrl-x history mode, you can search, and then just type !5 and it'll choose the 5th item, assuming you have it setup that way

#### key points

```rust
let list = help commands | select name # This breaks
let $list = (help commands | select name | first 10) # This works
```

#### building a string or concatenation

is build-str the only way to build a string?
we don't have an append or something like that. right?
you can also do "hello" + " world"

#### sourcing a file

source requires a known string. it doesn't support dynamically creating a string.  it's a design choice because: In Nushell, we're trying to make it so we know all of the source at "parse time". This lets us later add really good IDE support, and for Nushell to more easily scale up to large projects

#### $in notes

when you want to just grab what the next to last pipeline is outputting and test it (for whatever reason)...

And $in is the variable that allows you to work
with all of the data coming in from the pipeline in one place.

The `$in` variable will collect the pipeline into a value for you, allowing you to access the whole stream as a parameter.

```rust
"john ran to the store" | str length | $in > 25
```

```rust
rg -F '$in'

is there a difference between Value::as_string and Value::into_string?

as_string() converts any value that supports it to a string. into_string() formats the value and prints it, even lists etc. Maybe into_string() could be called print() or format() or something.

yeah, in theory there's a difference, so we don't accidentally convert something to string that shouldn't be but, like your external args, we should be able to safely convert ints to strings


#### There are two types of Streams in Nushell

* ListStream
* RawStream

ListStreams are used for Values any time you have an iterator

RawStreams are used for externals as well as the
open command when you don't have a file extension that
you know about.  In other words, it goes to raw when you do not know what
you are going to get back...

Both of these streams are referenced in nu-protocol in
* pipeline_data.rs
* value/stream.rs

#### what is the **exempt** label in issues

exempt from the stale bot

#### what is --testbin

--testbin String
what does it mean to run internal test binary ?

It's a known external we can call from our tests, since not all platforms have echo, cat, etc...

ok so that means an end user would never use that feature (except if they were writing tests as a nushell developer for our code base)

but these spans need to be valid spans for this to work, and you can't create valid spans yourself (you need to use helpers like metadata).

#### append command

To see raw input values print val in the **append** command

```rust
let val: Value = call.req(engine_state, stack, 0)?;
println!("{:?}",val);
let vec: Vec<Value> = process_value(val);

#### Getting column data

* get_data_by_key

commands that use get_data_by_key include **empty?** and **compact**

If you review empty? and debug the code you will see that given a particular column name

```rust
for column in column_paths.clone() {
    let path = column.into_string();
    let data = input.get_data_by_key(&path);
    println!("{:?} {:?}",path,data);
```

It goes through and prints each value going down the column...

* follow_cell_path

```rust
PathMember::Int
PathMember::String
```

The String arguments to follow_cell_path are for the column names.
The Int arguments to follow_cell_path are for the rows.

```rust
[[a,b];[rick,pete], [bill,paul]] | get a
[[a,b];[rick,pete], [bill,paul]] | get b
[[a,b];[rick,pete], [bill,paul]] | get 0
[[a,b];[rick,pete], [bill,paul]] | get 1
```

For more details...
```rust
rg follow_cell_path
```

```rust
fn run(
    &self,
    engine_state: &EngineState,
    stack: &mut Stack,
    call: &Call,
    input: PipelineData,
) -> Result<nu_protocol::PipelineData, nu_protocol::ShellError> {
    let columns: Vec<CellPath> = call.rest(engine_state, stack, 0)?;
    let span = call.head;
```

In lots of commands you see the "call.rest" feature, this functionality
is defined in the nu-engine crate in [call_ext](https://github.com/nushell/engine-q/blob/main/crates/nu-engine/src/call_ext.rs)

```rust
pub trait CallExt {

#### Random commands

```rust

we use this thing called rust-embed to embed things into the binary. Right now it looks like we're embedding themes for doing html, but I think you can use it for this as well

#### General Questions

#### what is our convention about commands having underscores ?

It's because commands like move_ is also a Rust keyword.

So commands like **let, do, if** have **underscore**, otherwise when you want to include them as a module, you'd type mod if and the compiler would complain that you cannot put if after mod.

#### Code Questions

example 24-bit terminals on mac including kitty, tabby, iterm2,
the default mac terminal is not 24-bit.

#### Anyone has an idea how to check if a value's type is Record?

You can pattern-match on the value:
```rust
if let Value::Record { .. } = value { <code> }
```

#### Do not use...

```rust
Span::unknown()
```

[As discussed here in PR 242](https://github.com/nushell/engine-q/issues/242#issuecomment-997017183)

When working on commands, you can use call.head (this is a good option for new values created within the command) or reuse spans that come with Values from the input stream or command arguments. To get it right requires a bit of playing around so a good idea is to also purposefully trigger the errors and see how the messages look like.

* nakst Philosophically, what is the difference between a shell and a scripting language REPL? (Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask)
My intuition is that the former is designed for programmatic coordination of other applications, while the latter is instead aimed primarily at computation. But I'm interested to hear what people who have spent more time thinking about shells would argue.

* jt
for nushell, we're trying to merge the two concepts into one
traditionally a shell would be for interacting with the system directly and a REPL would be for interacting with the language's engine directly. For us, we'd like to do both equally well

* nakst
yeah, I'm trying to make a REPL for my scripting language but give it some shell-like capabilities
I find a little difficult to strike the right balance between the two

#### Where does Nushell come from

* [nu comes from](https://jel.jewish-languages.org/words/416)
* [discord](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/614613939334152217/968447837241225276)

"it's a pun on new, but also comes from hebrew/yiddish
(originally named by Yehuda)"

#### Move nth to select PR

This moves nth into select. This works by looking at the cell path we're given. If the cell path is a number, we follow the same logic as get: instead of a column name, use this as a row number.

The end result is that now select works like get, but instead of extracting data, it down-selects data and keeps the original shape intact. I think this will help teaching, as you can remember that one commands down-selects and one extracts and that works either for colum...

#### When do I use Snake and when do I use Kebab ?

We know we didn't like either extreme, so after chatting with folks I think we should have a balance between the two: Here's my proposal:

Snake:
  * Column names
  * Cell paths (cell paths are column names)
  * Record fields (record fields are column names)
  * Variables (less confusing if you have math, eg) a_b - c_d is easier than a-b - c-d
  * env vars

Kebab:
  * Command names
  * Subcommand names
  * Flags (kebab flags appear to be the standard for most of the apps I checked)

### Cargo commands

Relevant cargo commands to track down dependencies and get rid of duplicated crates.  @sholderbach mentioned these two commands in our core team meeting.

```rust
cargo tree -- duplicated
cargo build -- timings
```
