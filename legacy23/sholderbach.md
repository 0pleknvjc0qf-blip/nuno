## The Nushell Record API

This is great work and something that should be clearly understood as it improves
the ease of use for Nushell developers moving forward.

Most of the documentation for the PRs are in the PR itself so this simply outlines
and supplements what @sholderbach and @ianmanske has already documented.

### PRs in order

* [Create Record type](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10103)
