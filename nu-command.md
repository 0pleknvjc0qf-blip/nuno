I currently have 3 repos related to nu-command...

### nu-command-core

This is the latest work on this subject and is just the core commands.   
The *nana* branch adds in table which nana wants to see...

the core branch pulls in 162 crates.  
the nana branch pulls in 182 crates.   
meaning the Table command pulls in 20 extra crates...

### nu-command-tiny is a legacy repo.

### nu-command-less is a legacy repo.

The 2 legacy repos will get deleted post 0.62.0 after I upgrade
nu-command-core to version 0.62.0
