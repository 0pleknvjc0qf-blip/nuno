## Nushell AI Guidelines

### Summary of the Document

- Do not use the AI model to communicate with the PR reviewer if you are a native English speaker
use your own words
- Fully understand each line of code that gets submitted in a PR

### Scope of this document

This document is about how Nushell contributors interact with the community as a whole
most specifically in the context of Pull Requests (PRs) but also in other areas
including Discussions, Issues, and Discord.

Over the past couple of months we have noticed that in some cases developers
are using the AI tool output as a replacement for their own words in dialogs
and code.

This has led to some confusing and unclear direction in our policy about
how we want to move forward on this subject.  This document will attempt
to outline a path ahead :)

### Pull Requests

The most important concept about submitting a PR to Nushell is that if
you do use an AI tool to assist you in writing the code you must fully
understand each and every line of code that gets submitted.  Relying
on an AI tool to "write the code for you" and not carefully reviewing
each line of code that gets generated and understanding what it does
will not help the Nushell community and codebase move forward in a sustainable
fashion.
