whats the nu equivalent to a && b? so run command a, and if it exits with code 0, run command b.

jt   
a; b

LordMZTE  
doesnt that also run b if a fails?

jt  
exit code 0 isn't really success, non-zero isn't really failure, sadly ðŸ˜¦
this is a "how posix works in the real world" kind of issue

LordMZTE  
i really need that for my use case ðŸ˜› guess ill just work with fish shell for now

jt  
for nu a; b means "run a and then if it errors, don't run b. Otherwise, run b"
which isn't exit codes but nushell's internal error system, which actually does mean failure or success

LordMZTE  
oh ok! thats when i want then
hmm nah it just ran the second command although the first one failed :/

jt  
is a an external or internal command?
LordMZTE â€” Today at 10:04 AM
external

jt  
then you'll need a way to convert the exit code into an error
(or just check the exit code)
the reason we don't turn exit non-zero into errors is because it breaks too many external commands, as they use non-zero exit codes as information to the user, not as a sign of failure

in 0.44, we had an optional flag you could turn on if you wanted that behaviour, though I don't think it's been ported to 0.59
