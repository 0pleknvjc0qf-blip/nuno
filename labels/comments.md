## Label Categories

All in all I think the labeling system is pretty robust and very clear on
what each label means and how they can be applied.

The only labels I believe can be somehow reduced or are not as clearly
"well defined" are the ones below I label as *concept*.

Not real happy with the name *concept* so if someone has a better name great !

I do believe that most of the labels below do fit into this yet to be named
category :)

### Concepts

| Category| Label|
| ---------| --------|
| concept | delight |
| concept | duplicate |
| concept | enhancement |
| concept | good first issue |
| concept | help wanted |
| concept | investigate |
| concept | language |
| concept | more information needed |
| concept | naming things |
| concept | needs design |
| concept | needs triage |
| concept | optimization |
| concept | performance |
| concept | polish |
| concept | post-1.0 |
| concept | priority |
| concept | quality-of-life |
| concept | question |
| concept | refactor |
| concept | scripting |
| concept | semantics |
| concept | stability-concern |
| concept | syntax |
| concept | unhelpful-error |
| concept | wontfix |

The platform labels are fine but it was obvious that they fit into a well defined category.

### Platforms

| Category| Label|
| ---------| --------|
| platform | platform-specific |
| platform | POSIX-expectations |
| platform | android |
| platform | freebsd |
| platform | linux |
| platform | macos |
| platform | windows |
| platform | wasm |
